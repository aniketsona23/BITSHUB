In the command line, type: > ls Hello .java > javac Hello .java > ls Hello .java, Hello .class > java Hello Hello World! Explaining the Process 1) creating a source file - a source file contains text written in the Java programming language, created using any text editor on any system. 2) compiling the source file Java compiler (javac) reads the source file and translates its text into instructions that the Java interpreter can understand. These instructions are called bytecode. 3) running the compiled program Java interpreter (java) installed takes as input the bytecode file and carries out its instructions by translating them on the fly into instructions that your computer can understand. Java Program Explained Hello is the name of the class: class Hello{ main is the method with one parameter args and no results : public static void main (String[] args) { println is a method in the standard System class: System.out.println(“First Java program.\"); } } Main Method The main method must be present in every Java application: 1)public static void main(String[] args) where: a)public means that the method can be called by any object b)static means that the method is shared by all instances c)void means that the method does not return any value 2) When the interpreter executes an application, it starts by calling its main method which in turn invokes other methods in this or other classes. 3) The main method accepts a single argument – a string array, which holds all command-line parameters. Getting Started: (1) Create the source file: \\uf0d8open a text editor, type in the code which defines a class (HelloWorldApp ) and then save it in a file (',\n",

Most constructors initialize the object’s fields. Constructors may take parameters. A class may have several constructors that differ in the number or types of their parameters. All of a class’s constructors have the same name as the class. Constructors go = new JButton(\"Go\"); Constructors (cont’d) Call them using the new operator: cube = new FallingCube (CUBESIZE); ... t = new Timer (delay, this) Calls FallingCube ’s constructor with CUBESIZE as the parameter Calls Timer’s constructor with delay and this (i.e. this object) as the parameters (see Java docs for javax.swing.Timer ) Class constructors The purpose of the constructor is to initialize the instance variables –Default constructor –Constructor overloading ** forgetting to call a constructor ** constructor is invoked only when an object is first created. You cannot call the constructor to reset an object. Constructors If a class has more than one constructor, they are ―overloaded‖ and must have different numbers and/or types of arguments. Programmers often provide a ―no -args‖ constructor that takes no arguments. If a programmer does not define any constructors, Java provides one default no-args constructor, which allocates memory and sets fields to the default values.

The name of a method that returns the value of a field often starts with get: getWidth , getX The name of a method that sets the value of a field often starts with set: setLocation , setText Method Method Qualifier –Access Modifier •Access Permission Level to Method from Other Class •Same as that of access modifier in field –static •static method, class method •Same role of Global function •Use only the static field of correspond class or the static method •Can be referred by only class name ClassName.methodName; Method –final •Final method •Method which cannot be redefined in subclass –synchronized •Synchronization method •Control the threads so that only one thread can always access the target –native •To use the implementation written in other programming languages such as C language Overloaded Methods Methods of the same class that have the same name but different numbers or types of arguments are called overloaded methods. Use overloaded methods when they perform similar tasks: public void move (int x, int y) { ... } public void move (double x, double y) { ... } public void move (Point p)',\n",

The compiler knows which one to call based on the number and the types of the arguments: Circle circle = new Circle(5); circle. move (50, 100) ; ... Point center = new Point(50, 100); circle. move (center) ; ... public class Circle { ... public void move (int x, int y) { ... } public void move (Point p) { ... } ... } Method Overloading –In case of method overloading, compilers do the following : Seek the method having the same parameter type Seek the method having the parameter which can be converted by basic type casting Static Static Fields A static field (a.k.a. class field or class variable ) is shared by all objects of the class. A static field can hold a constant shared by all objects of the class: A non-static field (a.k.a. instance field or instance variable ) belongs to an individual object. Static Fields Static fields are stored with the class code, separately from non-static fields that describe an individual object. Public static fields , usually global constants , are referred to in other classes using ―dot notation‖: ClassName .constName double area = Math.PI * r * r; setBackground( Color.blue ); c.add(btn, BorderLayout.NORTH) ; System.out .println(area); Static Methods Static methods can access and manipulate a class’s static fields. Static methods cannot access non-static fields or call non-static methods of the class. Static methods are called using ―dot notation‖: ClassName .statMethod (...) double x = Math.random() ; double y = Math.sqrt (x); System.exit() ; Instance Methods Non-static methods are also called instance methods. An instance method is called for a particular object using ―dot notation‖: objName.instMethod(...); Instance methods can access ALL fields and call ALL methods of their class — both class and instance fields and methods. Static (Class) vs. Non-Static (Instance) public class MyClass { public static final int statConst; private static int statVar; private int instVar; ... ... public static int statMethod(...) { statVar = statConst; statMethod2(...); instVar = ...; instMethod(...); } \\uf0c8 \\uf0ca public int instMethod(...) { statVar = statConst; inst Var = statConst; instVar = statMethod(...); statVar = instMethod2(...); ... } public int instMethod2(...) { ... } ... } Error!

The return statement is used to immediately quit the method and return a value: return expression ; The type of the return value or expression must match the method’s declared return type. return A method can have several return statements; then all but one of them must be inside an if or else (or in a switch ): public someType myMethod (...) { ... if (...) return < expression1 >; else return < expression2 >; ... return < expression3 >; } return A boolean method can return true, false , or the result of a boolean expression: public boolean myMethod (...) { ... if (...) return true ; ... return n % 2 == 0 ; } return A void method can use a return statement to quit the method early: public void myMethod (...) { ... if (...) return ; ... } No need for a redundant return at the end return If its return type is a class, the method returns a reference to an object (or null). Often the returned object is created in the method using new.

Extending interfaces – about methods •If a declared method in a subinterface has the same signature as an inherited method and the same return type, then the new declaration overrides the inherited method in its superinterface. If the only difference is in the return type, then there will be a compile-time error •An interface can inherit more than one methods with the same signature and return type. A class can implement different interfaces containing methods with the same signature and return type. •Overriding in interfaces has NO question of ambiguity. The real behavior is ultimately decided by the implementation in the class implementing them. The real issue is whether a single implementation can honor all the contracts implied by that method in different interfaces •Methods with same name but different parameter lists are overloaded Interface References intfRef.varName intfRef.mthName(args) Referencing an Interface Variable interface A { void display(String s);} class C1 implements A { public void display(String s) { System.out.println(\"C1: \" + s); }} class C2 implements A { public void display(String s) { System.out.println(\"C2: \" + s); } } class C3 implements A { public void display(String s) { System.out.println(\"C3: \" + s); }} class InterfaceReferenceVariable { public static void main(String args[]) { A a; a = new C1(); a.display(\"String 1\"); a = new C2(); a.display(\"String 2\"); a = new C3(); a.display(\"String 3\"); } } Result : C1: String 1 C2: String 2 C3: String 3 Marker interfaces •A marker (tagging) interface has neither methods nor constants, its only purpose is to allow the use of instanceof in a type inquiry.

Companies use their reversed Internet domain name to begin their package name –For example, com.example.orion for a package named orion created by a programmer at example.com. •Name collisions that occur within a single company need to be handled by convention within that company, perhaps by including the region or the project name after the company name –(for example, com.company.region.package). •Packages in the Java language itself begin with java. or javax. Naming conventions •In some cases, the internet domain name may not be a valid package name. –This can occur if the domain name contains a hyphen or other special character, if the package name begins with a digit or other character that is illegal to use as the beginning of a Java name, or if the package name contains a reserved Java keyword, such as \"int\". –In this event, the suggested convention is to add an underscore. –Ex: clipart-open.org \\uf0e0org.clipart_open Using Package Members •The types that comprise a package are known as the package members . To use a public package member from outside its package, you must do one of the following: –Refer to the member by its fully qualified name •graphics.Rectangle myRect = new graphics.Rectangle(); –Import the package member •import graphics.Rectangle; Rectangle myRectangle = new Rectangle(); –Import the member\\'s entire package •import java.util.*; •import graphics.*; •import graphics.A*; //does not work Packaging your classes •Add a package statement as the first statement in the source file containing the class definition •It must always be the first statement •Ex: package geometry; //Sphere.java package geometry; public class Sphere { //details of the class definition } keyword necessary Packaging your classes •Directory : geometry •File: Sphere.java •Compiling: Ensure that you are out of the directory javac /geometry/Sphere.java To execute java geometry.Sphere For a large number of files in a package you can use javac /geometry/*.java All interdependencies will be figured out by the compiler Packages and directory structure •A package is intimately related to the directory structure in which it is stored •A class with a Classname must be stored in a file called Classname.java •Similarly, all the files for classes within a package, packageName must be included in a directory with the name, packageName. •A package need not have a single name. it can be a sequence of names separated by a period package geometry.shapes3D; package geometry.shapes2D; –shapes3D and shapes2D are sub directories of geometry',\n",

Setting classpath •From the command prompt, set CLASSPATH = .;c:\\\\MySource; c:\\\\MyPackages •Unless a class path is set, or set incorrectly, java will not be able to find the classes in any new packages you might create. Adding classes from a Package to your Program •Classes with ‘public’ are accessible to your program by using ‘import’ statement. –import geometry.shapes3D.*; //includes all the classes from this package –‘*’ selects all the classes in the package –You can refer any public class in the package –If you have to add a specific class, specify explicitly like, import geometry.shapes3D.Sphere; –‘*’ can be only used to select all the classes in a package. You cannot use geometry.* to select all the packages in the directory geometry . Encapsulation of classes into a package • Add a class into a package — two steps: 1.put the name of the package at the top of your source file 2.put the files in a package into a subdirectory which matches the full package name stored in the file “Employee.java” which is stored under “somePath/com/hostname/corejava /” package com.hostname.corejava; public class Employee { . . . } Setting the class path E.g. - current classpath: /home/user/classdir:.:/home/user/archives/archive.jar - to search for the class file of the com.horstmann.corejava.Employee class first searchs in the system class files that are stored in archives in the jre/lib and jre/lib/ext directories. If it can’t find the class there it will search in the order: 1) /home/user/classdir/com/horstmann/corejava/Employee.class 2) ./com/horstmann/corejava/Employee.class 3) com/horstmann/corejava/Employee.class inside /home/user/archives/archive.jar - if found the interpreter stops searching process Naming conventions •Package names : start with lowercase letter \\uf0d8 E.g. java.util, java.net, java.io . . . •Class names : start with uppercase letter \\uf0d8 E.g.

LinkedList should have a int variable numNodes which will keep a count of ALL nodes created Inner Classes \\uf0cf A nested class that is not static is called an inner class. \\uf0cf An inner class is associated with an object of its enclosing class and it has direct and unlimited access to that object's instance variables and methods . \\uf0cf A nested class can be declared at the top level inside a class or inside any block of code . 13 Inner classes class Outer { int n; class Inner { int ten = 10; void setNToTen( ) { n = ten; } } void setN ( ) { new Inner( ).setNToTen( ); } } Inner Class \\uf0cfName Reference \\uf0cfinside OuterClass : Use InnerClass Simple name \\uf0cf outside OuterClass : OuterClass.InnerClass \\uf0cfAccess Modifier \\uf0cfpublic, private, protected Inner class cannot have static variables public static void main(String[] args) { OuterClass outObj = new OuterClass(); OuterClass.InnerClass inObj = outObj.new InnerClass(); } 15 Nesting Inner Classes \\uf0cfIt is legal to nest inner classes within inner classes \\uf0cfThe rules are the same as before, but the names get longer \\uf0cfGiven class A, which has public inner class B, which has public inner class C, then the following is valid: A aObject = new A(); A.B bObject = aObject.new B(); A.B.C cObject = bObject.new C(); Name of Inner Class Java Compiler Java Source ClassName.class OuterClassName$InnerClassName.class class Outer { class Inner1 { class Inner2 { // … } // ... } // ... } Outer.class Outer$Inner1.class Outer$Inner1$Inner2.class Simple inner class example class Outer{ private int x1; Outer(int x1){ this.x1 = x1; } public void foo(){ System.out.println(“fooing”);} public class Inner{ private int x1 = 0; void foo(){ System.out.println(“Outer value of x1: “ + Outer.this.x1); System.out.println(“Inner value of x1: “ + this.x1); } } Simple example, cont -- driver • Rules for instantiation public class TestDrive{ public static void main(String[] args ){ Outer outer = new Outer(); Inner inner = outer.new Inner(); //must call new through //outer object handle inner.foo (); // note that this can only be done if inner is visible // according to the regular scoping rules } } Non-static Classes — Inner classes \\uf0cfInner classes are associated with instances of its enclosing class. public class BankAccount { private long number; // account number private long balance; // current balance private Action lastAct; //last action\",\n",

When this occurs, the current enclosing object this is associated with the inner object by default. lastAct = this.new Action(“deposit”, amount); \\uf0cfWhen deposit creates an Action object, a reference to the enclosing BankAccount object is automatically stored in the Action object. Inner classes (cont.) \\uf0cfmethod for transfer is added public void transfer(BankAccount other, long amount) { other.withdraw(amount); deposit(amount); lastAct = this.new Action(“transfer”, amount ); other.lastAct = other.new Action(“transfer”, amount); // will this work? } Inner classes (cont.) \\uf0cfThe enclosing class can also access the private members of its inner class, but only via explicit reference to an inner class object. \\uf0cfAn object of the enclosing class need not have any inner class objects associated with it, or it could have many. \\uf0cfAn inner class acts as a top- level class except that it can’t have static members (except for final static fields). \\uf0cfInner classes can also be extended. Inheritance, Scoping and Hiding \\uf0cfAll members declared within the enclosing class are said to be in scope inside the inner class. \\uf0cfAn inner class’s own fields and methods can hide those of the enclosing object. Two possible ways: 1). A member with same name is declared in the inner class \\uf0cfAny direct use of the name refers to the version inside the inner class class Host { int x; class Helper { void increment() {int x=0; x++;} } } \\uf0cfAccess to the enclosing object’s members needs be preceded by this explicitly Inheritance, Scoping and Hiding 2). A member with the same name is inherited by the inner class \\uf0cfThe direct use of the name is not allowed class Host { int x; class Helper extends Unknown { //Unknown class has a field x void increment() {x++;} } } \\uf0cfUse enclosingClassName.this.name to refer to the version in the outer class \\uf0cfor super.name to refer to the version in the super class \\uf0cfUse this.name in the inner class Specifying which scope you want: public class ScopeConflict { String s = \"outer\"; class Inner extends SuperClass { String s = \"inner\"; void foo(){ System.out.println(this.s); System.out.println(super.s); System.out.println(ScopeConflict.this.s); } } } class SuperClass { String s = \"super\"; } output: inner',\n",

They are called local inner classes. \\uf0cfYou can actually declare an inner class inside of a method, just like you could declare a local variable. \\uf0cfLocal classes do not get an access modifier – they are automatically restricted to the method they are defined in \\uf0cfCan only refer to final members of the enclosing class \\uf0cfThey are NOT members of the class which contains the code but are local to that block, as a local variable. \\uf0cfThey are completely inaccessible outside of the block. \\uf0cfOnly one modifier is allowed —final—which makes them unextendable Anonymous Inner classes \\uf0cfWhen using a local inner class, if you only want to make one instance of it, you don ’t even need to give it a name \\uf0cfThis is known as an anonymous inner class \\uf0cfThese are convenient for event programming \\uf0cfHowever, the syntax is extremely cryptic. Anonymous Inner classes \\uf0cfYou have to look very carefully to see a difference between construction of a new object, and construction of a new inner class extending a class. //A person object from Person class Person queen=new Person(“Mary”); //Person Object _______________________________ //An object of an inner class extending Person interface Person count = new Person() { //class code here }; Anonymous Inner classes \\uf0cfAnonymous Inner classes cannot have constructors, since constructors have to have the same name as the class, and these classes have no names. \\uf0cfAs you can see, the syntax for these is confusing – both for people writing and reading the code. Use this with care, if at all. Anonymous Inner classes public void start(final double rate) { ActionListener adder = new ActionListener() { public void actionPerformed(ActionEvent evt) { double interest = balance * rate / 100; balance += interest; } }; \\uf0cfThis is saying, construct a new object of a class that implements the ActionListener interface, where the one required method (actionPerformed) is defined inside the brackets. 34 Abstract Data Types Abstract Data Types •An abstract data type is a mathematical set of data, along with operations defined on that kind of data •Examples: \\uf077int: it is the set of integers (up to a certain magnitude), with operations +, -, /, *, % \\uf077double : it’s the',\n",

MyArrayList MyStack MyLinkedList MyQueue –Using composition: You can declare an array list as a data field in the stack class, and a linked list as a data field in the queue class. MyStack MyArrayList MyQueue MyLinkedList 14 Composition is Better Both designs are fine, but using composition is better because it enables you to declare a complete new stack class and queue class without inheriting the unnecessary and inappropriate methods from the array list and linked list. 15 MyStack and MyQueue MyStack -list: MyArrayList +isEmpty(): boolean +getSize(): int +peek(): Object +pop(): Object +push(o: Object): Object +search(o: Object): int Returns true if this stack is empty. Returns the number of elements in this stack. Returns the top element in this stack. Returns and removes the top element in this stack. Adds a new element to the top of this stack. Returns the position of the specified element in this sta ck. MyQueue -list: MyLinkedList +enqueue(element: Object): void +dequeue(): Object +getSize(): int Adds an element to this queue. Removes an element from this queue. Returns the number of elements from this queue. MyStack MyQueue GENERAL LINEAR LISTS •Stacks and queues defined in the two previous sections are restricted linear lists . •A general linear list is a list in which operations, such as insertion and deletion, can be done anywhere in the list—at the beginning, in the middle or at the end. Figure shows a general linear list. Operations on general linear lists Six common operations: list, insert , delete , retrieve , traverse and empty . The list operation The list operation creates an empty list. The following shows the format: 18 List features •ORDERING : maintains order elements were added (new elements are added to the end by default) •DUPLICATES : yes (allowed) •OPERATIONS : add element to end of list, insert element at given index, clear all elements, search for element, get element at given index, remove element at given index, get size –some of these operations are inefficient!

It returns a positive value if o1 is greater than o2. Otherwise, a negative value is returned. User-Defined Order Reverse alphabetical order of strings public class StringComparator implements Comparator { public int compare(Object o1, Object o2) { if (o1 != null && o2 != null && o1 instanceof String && o2 instanceof String) { String s1 = (String) o1; String s2 = (String) o2; return - (s1.compareTo(s2)); } else { return 0; } } } Object Oriented Programming Generics Why generics? •Person [] people = new Person [25]; // you must say what’s in the array people[0] = \"Sally\"; // syntax error •ArrayList people = new ArrayList(); // but anything could go in the ArrayList! people.add(\"Sally\"); // sometime later... Person p = (Person)people.get(0); // runtime error •ArrayList <Person> people = new ArrayList <Person> (); // say what’s in it people.add(\"Sally\"); // syntax error •Since Java 5, collections should be used only with generics Generics •A generic is a method that is recompiled with different types as the need arises •The bad news: –Instead of saying: List words = new ArrayList(); –You\\'ll have to say: List<String> words = new ArrayList <String> (); •The good news: –Replaces runtime type checks with compile-time checks –No casting; instead of String title = (String) words.get(i); you use String title = words.get(i); •Some classes and interfaces that have been “genericized” are: Vector , ArrayList , LinkedList , Hashtable , HashMap , Stack , Queue , PriorityQueue , Dictionary , TreeMap and TreeSet Genericized types are still types •ArrayList myList = new ArrayList (); •ArrayList<String> myList = new ArrayList<String> (); ↑this is the type ↑this is the type again •You can use generic types as method parameters: String findLongest( ArrayList<String> myList) { ... } –But you don’t mention types when you call a method: String longestString = findLongest(myList); •You can return a generic type from a method: ArrayList<String> readList() { ... } Generic Iterators •To',\n",

RuntimeException and other exceptions Focus on the Exception branch \\uf06eTwo branches of Exception \\uf0a8exceptions that derived from RuntimeException \\uf06eexamples: a bad cast, an out- of-array access \\uf06ehappens because errors exist in your program. Your fault. \\uf0a8those not in the type of RuntimeException \\uf06eexample: trying to open a malformed URL \\uf06eprogram is good, other bad things happen. Not your fault. Focus on the Exception branch \\uf06eChecked exceptions vs. unchecked exceptions \\uf0a8Unchecked exceptions : exceptions derived from the class Error or the class RuntimeException \\uf0a8Checked exceptions : all other exceptions that are not unchecked exceptions \\uf06eIf they occur, they must be dealt with in some way. \\uf06eThe compiler will check whether you provide exception handlers for checked exceptions which may occur Approaches to handling an exception 1.Prevent the exception from happening 2.Catch it in the method in which it occurs, and either a.Fix up the problem and resume normal execution b.Rethrow it c.Throw a different exception 3.Declare that the method throws the exception 4.With 1. and 2.a. the caller never knows there was an error. 5.With 2.b., 2.c., and 3., if the caller does not handle the exception, the program will terminate and display a stack trace Example public class myexception{ public static void main(String args[]){ try{ File f = new File(“myfile”); FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f); }catch(FileNotFoundException ex){ File f = new File(“Available File”); FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f); } finally{ // the finally block } //continue processing here. }} •In this example we are trying to open a file and if the file does not exists we can do further processing in the catch block. •The try and catch blocks are used to identify possible exception conditions. We try to execute any statement that might throw an exception and the catch block is used for any exceptions caused. •If the try block does not throw any exceptions, then the catch block is not executed. •The finally block is always executed irrespective of whether the exception is thrown or not. Using throws clause Use the throws to handle the exception in the calling function. public class myexception{ public static void main(String args[]){ try{ checkEx(); } catch(FileNotFoundException ex){ } } public void checkEx() throws FileNotFoundException{ File f = new File(“myfile”); FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f); //continue processing here. } } Using throws clause •In this example, the main method calls the checkex() method and the checkex method tries to open a file, If the file in not available, then an exception is raised and passed to the main method, where it is handled. Catching Multiple exceptions public class myexception{ public static void main(String args[]){ try{ File f = new File(“ myfile ”); FileInputStream fis = new FileInputStream(f); } catch(FileNotFoundException ex){ File f =',\n",

Exception Handling Basics \\uf06eThree parts to Exception handling 1. claiming exception 2. throwing exception 3. catching exception \\uf06eA method has the option of throw ing one or more exceptions when specified conditions occur. This exception must be claim ed by the method. Another method calling this method must either catch or re throw the exception. (unless it is a RuntimeException) Claiming Exceptions \\uf06eMethod declaration must specify every exception that the method potentially throws MethodDeclaration throws Exception1, Exception2, ..., ExceptionN \\uf06eExceptions themselves are concrete subclasses of Throwable and must be defined and locatable in regular way. Throwing Exception \\uf06eTo throw an Exception, use the throw keyword followed by an instance of the Exception class void foo() throws SomeException{ if (whatever) {...} else{ throw new SomeException(...)} \\uf06eNote that if a method foo has a throw clause within it, that the Exception that is thrown (or one of its superclasses) must be claimed after the signature. Catching Exceptions \\uf06eThe third piece of the picture is catching exceptions. \\uf06eThis is what you will do with most commonly, since many of java’s library methods are defined to throw one or more runtime exception. \\uf06eCatching exceptions: \\uf0a8When a method is called that throws and Exception e.g SomeException, it must be called in a try-catch block: try { foo(); } catch(SomeException se) { ... } Example1 import java.io.*; public class Exception1{ public static void main(String[] args){ InputStream f; try{ f = new FileInputStream(\"foo.txt\"); } catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe){ System.out.println(fnfe.getMessage()); } } } Example2 import java.io.*; public class Exception2{ public static void main(String[] args){ InputStream fin; try{ fin = new FileInputStream(\"foo.txt\"); int input = fin.read(); } catch(FileNotFoundException fnfe){ System.out.println(fnfe.getMessage()); } catch(IOException ioe){ System.out.println(ioe.getMessage()); } }} Catching exceptions \\uf06eChecked exceptions handling is strictly enforced. If you invoke a method that lists a checked exception in its throws clause, you have three choices 1.Catch the exception and handle it 2.Declare the exception in your own throws clause, and let the exception',\n",

If you invoke a method that lists a checked exception in its throws clause, you have three choices 1.Catch the exception and handle it 2.Declare the exception in your own throws clause, and let the exception pass through your method (you may have a finally clause to clean up first) 3.Catch the exception and map it into one of your exceptions by throwing an exception of a type declared in your own throws clause try/catch clause (1) \\uf0a8If no exception occurs during the execution of the statements in the try clause, it finishes successfully and all the catch clauses are skipped \\uf0a8If any of the code inside the try block throws an exception, either directly via a throw or indirectly by a method invoked inside it 1. The program skips the remainder of the code in the try block 2. The catch clauses are examined one by one, to see whether the type of the thrown exception object is compatible with the type declared in the catch . 3. If an appropriate catch clause is found, the code inside its body gets executed and all the remaining catch clauses are skipped. 4. If no such a catch clause is found, then the exception is thrown into an outer try that might have a catch clause to handle it \\uf0a8A catch clause with a superclass exceptionType cannot precede a catch clause with a subclass exceptionType finally clause \\uf06eYou can use a finally clause without a catch clause \\uf06eSometimes the finally clause can also thrown an exception Example public boolean searchFor(String file, String word) throws StreamException { Stream input = null; try { some code which may throw an StreamException } finally { input.close(); // this may throw anIOException } } finally clause \\uf06eYou may want to do some actions whether or not an exception is thrown. finally clause does this for you Graphics g = image.getGraphics(); try { //1 code that might throw exceptions //2 } catch (IOException e) { //3 show error dialog (// some code which may throw exceptions) //4 } finally { g.dispose(); (// some code which will not throw exceptions) //5 } //6 \\uf0d8No exception is thrown: \\uf0d8An exception is thrown and caught by the catch clause \\uf0d8The catch clause doesn’t throw any other exception: \\uf0d8The catch clause throws an exception itself: , and the exception is thrown back to the caller of this method \\uf0d8An exception is thrown but not caught by the catch clause: , and the exception is thrown back to the caller of this method 1, 2, 5, 6 1, 3, 4, 5, 6 1, 3, 5 1, 5 Creating new exception types \\uf06eExceptions are objects.

New exception types should extend Exception or one of its subclasses \\uf06eWhy creating new exception types? 1. describe the exceptional condition in more details than just the string that Exception provides 2. the type of the exception is an important part of the exception data – programmers need to do some actions exclusively to one type of exception conditions, not others E.g. suppose there is a method to update the current value of a named attribute of an object, but the object may not contain such an attribute currently. We want an exception to be thrown to indicate the occurring of if such a situation public class NoSuchAttributeException extends Exception { public String attrName; public NoSuchAttributeException (String name) { super(“No attribute named \\\\”” + name + “ \\\\” found”); attrName = name; } } Java Threads Introduction to multithreading in Java What is a Thread? •Individual and separate unit of execution that is part of a process –multiple threads can work together to accomplish a common goal •Video Game example –one thread for graphics –one thread for user interaction –one thread for networking What is a Thread? video interaction networking Video Game Process Advantages •easier to program –1 thread per task •can provide better performance –thread only runs when needed –no polling to decide what to do •multiple threads can share resources •utilize multiple processors if available Disadvantage •multiple threads can lead to deadlock –much more on this later •overhead of switching between threads Creating Threads (method 1) •extending the Thread class –must implement the run() method –thread ends when run() method finishes –call .start() to get the thread ready to run Creating Threads Example 1 class Output extends Thread { private String toSay; public Output(String st) { toSay = st; } public void run() { try { for(;;) { System.out.println(toSay ); sleep(1000); } } catch(InterruptedException e) { System.out.println(e); } }} Example 1 (continued) class Program { public static void main(String [] args) { Output thr1 = new Output(“Hello”); Output thr2 = new Output(“There”); thr1.start(); thr2.start(); } } •main thread is just another thread (happens to start first) •main thread can end before the others do •any thread can spawn more threads Creating Threads (method 2) •implementing Runnable interface –virtually identical to extending Thread class –must still define the run() method –setting up the threads is slightly different Creating Threads Example 2 class Output implements Runnable { private String toSay; public Output(String st) { toSay = st; } public void run() { try { for(;;) { System.out.println(toSay ); Thread.sleep (1000); } } catch(InterruptedException e) { System.out.println(e); }}} Example 2 (continued) class Program { public static void main(String [] args) { Output out1 = new Output(“Hello”); Output out2 = new Output(“There”); Thread thr1 = new Thread(out1); Thread thr2 = new Thread(out2); thr1.start(); thr2.start(); } } •main is a bit more complex •everything else identical for the most part Advantage of Using Runnable •remember - can only extend one class •implementing runnable allows class to',\n",

Events \\uf06cAn event can be defined as a type of signal to the program that something has happened. \\uf06cThe event is generated by external user actions such as mouse movements, mouse button clicks, and keystrokes, or by the operating system, such as a timer. Event Information \\uf06cid: A number that identifies the event. \\uf06ctarget : The source component upon which the event occurred. \\uf06carg: Additional information about the source components. \\uf06cx, y coordinates : The mouse pointer location when a mouse movement event occurred. \\uf06cclickCount : The number of consecutive clicks for the mouse events. For other events, it is zero. \\uf06cwhen : The time stamp of the event. \\uf06ckey: The key that was pressed or released.

For example, getSource returns the object that produced this event. \\uf06cA MouseEvent has methods getX, getY. Mouse Events \\uf06cMouse events are captured by an object which is a MouseListener and possibly a MouseMotionListener . \\uf06cA mouse listener is usually attached to a JPanel component. \\uf06cIt is not uncommon for a panel to serve as its own mouse listener: addMouseListener(this); addMouseMotionListener(this); // optional Mouse Events (cont‟d) \\uf06cMouse listener methods receive a MouseEvent object as a parameter. \\uf06cA mouse event can provide the coordinates of the event and other information: public void mousePressed(MouseEvent e) { int x = e.getX(); int y = e.getY(); int clicks = e.getClickCount(); } Mouse Events (cont‟d) \\uf06cThe MouseListener interface defines five methods: void mousePressed (MouseEvent e) void mouseReleased (MouseEvent e) void mouseClicked (MouseEvent e) void mouseEntered (MouseEvent e) void mouseExited (MouseEvent e) \\uf06cOne click and release causes several calls. Using only mouseReleased is usually a safe bet. Called when the mouse cursor enters/exits component‟s visible area Mouse Events (cont‟d) \\uf06cThe MouseMotionListener interface adds two methods: void mouseMoved (MouseEvent e) void mouseDragged (MouseEvent e) \\uf06cThese methods are usually used together with MouseListener methods (i.e., a class implements both interfaces). Called when the mouse has moved with a button held down 14 Event Handling Strategies: Pros and Cons \\uf06cSeparate Listener –Advantages •Can extend adapter and thus ignore unused methods •Separate class easier to manage –Disadvantage •Need extra step to call methods in main window \\uf06cMain window that implements interface –Advantage •No extra steps needed to call methods in main window –Disadvantage •Must implement methods you might not care about 15 Event Handling Strategies: Pros and Cons, cont. \\uf06cNamed inner class –Advantages •Can extend adapter and thus ignore unused methods •No extra steps needed to call methods in main window –Disadvantage •A bit harder to understand \\uf06cAnonymous inner class –Advantages •Same as named inner classes •Even shorter –Disadvantage •Much harder to understand Event Listeners Event Listeners \\uf06cListener objects is added to Button \\uf06cWhen the user clicks the button, \\uf06cButton object generates an ActionEvent object. \\uf06cThis calls the listener object ’s method and passes the ActionEvent object generated.
